# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles have undergone several changes from being jam-packed and choc full of features to now very minimal.
I find that a minimal config has served me the best. I avoid heavy reliance on language specific plugins and stick to built-ins as much as possible.

Feel free to re-use and tweak my configs!
